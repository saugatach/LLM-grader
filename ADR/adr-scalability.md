# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Scalability Strategy

### 1. Title
Evaluating and Selecting Scalability Strategy for Case Study Grading System

### 2. Context
The automated grading system needs to handle varying loads and processing requirements:
- Peak loads during exam periods (5x normal traffic)
- Large document processing (50MB+ case studies)
- Concurrent user access (1000+ students submitting)
- Real-time processing requirements
- Multiple AI model inference calls

### 3. Comparison of Scaling Approaches

| Approach | Purpose | How It Works | Best Use Cases | Limitations |
|----------|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Vertical Scaling** | Increase single node capacity | Adds more resources to existing servers | Simple applications, monolithic systems | Cost inefficient, hardware limits |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Distribute load across nodes | Adds more server instances | Microservices, stateless applications | Complex orchestration, data consistency |
| **Hybrid Scaling** | Optimize resource usage | Combines vertical and horizontal | Mixed workload systems | Complex management, higher overhead |

### 4. Decision
After evaluating multiple scaling strategies, we faced a choice between:

1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Simple implementation
   - 2x-3x capacity increase
   - 3000ms average response time
   - Higher costs per request

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Selected)**
   - Complex but flexible
   - Unlimited scaling potential
   - 800ms average response time
   - Better cost optimization

### 5. Selection and Justification
We selected Horizontal Scaling because:

1. **Load Characteristics**
   - Variable traffic patterns
   - Need for parallel processing
   - Stateless service design
   - Cost optimization requirements

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Auto-scaling groups for each service
   - Load balancing across instances
   - Distributed document processing
   - Queue-based workload distribution

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - 95th percentile response time: 800ms
   - Scaling threshold: 70% CPU utilization
   - Maximum instances: 20 per service
   - Minimum instances: 3 per service

### 6. Technical Considerations

#### Infrastructure Components
| Component | Technology | Configuration | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Load Balancer | AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ALB) | - Path-based routing<br>- SSL termination<br>- Health checks every 30s | Request distribution |
| Auto Scaling | AWS Auto Scaling Groups | - Target tracking scaling<br>- Step scaling policies<br>- Scheduled scaling for exam periods | Instance management |
| Container Orchestration | Kubernetes (EKS) | - Multi-AZ deployment<br>- Pod auto-scaling<br>- Resource quotas | Container management |
| CDN | CloudFront | - Regional edge caches<br>- HTTPS enforcement<br>- Custom error pages | Content delivery |

#### Data Storage & Search Infrastructure
| Component | Technology | Scaling Strategy | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|------------------|----------|
| Primary Storage | Amazon S3 | - Automatic scaling<br>- Multi-region replication | Document storage |
| Search Engine | Elasticsearch | - Multi-node cluster<br>- Sharding & replication | Full-text search |
| Cache Layer | Redis Cluster | - Master-replica<br>- Auto-failover | Response caching |
| Document DB | MongoDB Atlas | - Horizontal sharding<br>- Read replicas | Metadata storage |

### 7. Consequences

#### Positive Impact
- Improved resource utilization
- Better cost management
- Higher system availability
- Flexible capacity adjustment
- Efficient data retrieval and search
- Reliable document storage

#### Negative Impact
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for orchestration tools
- Data consistency challenges
- More complex monitoring
- Search cluster maintenance overhead
- Multiple data storage systems to manage

### 8. Conclusion
The Horizontal Scaling strategy, combined with appropriate data storage and search infrastructure, provides the best balance of performance, cost, and flexibility for our case study grading system. While it introduces some complexity, the benefits of improved resource utilization, unlimited scaling potential, and efficient data handling outweigh the management overhead.
